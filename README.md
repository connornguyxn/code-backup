# 1. What is this?

This repository is for storing and sharing my written code from competitive programming websites. Most of the code here is pretty quick and dirty, some are even unfinished, so I would only advise checking them out if you want to have a good laugh.

# 2. File prefixes

The file prefixes used in this project represent the website the problem is on for easier access.
