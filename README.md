# Inf1nity's Code Backup

### What is this?

 - This repository contains *almost* **all of my written code** *(except for projects, which will be in their own repos)* and *some* **personal files**.

### Purpose

**This repo is meant to be 2 things:**

  1. My doomsday bunker, where I can (hopefully) recover some of my *precious* code and data from in case something bad happens to my **only** laptop.

  2. My backpack, which I can access and edit almost anywhere and share with friends so they can improve it too. After all, this is the purpose of creating a repo, right?
