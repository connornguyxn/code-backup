# Inf1nity's Code Backup

### What is this?

 - This repository contains *almost* **all of my written code** *(except for projects, which will be in their own repos)* and **personal files** that have been encrypted by a 21 character password with both cases, numbers and special characters, so good luck trying to crack it :)

### Purpose

**This repo is meant to be 2 things:**

  1. My personal doomsday bunker, where I can (hopefully) recover some of my *precious* code and data from in case something bad happens to my **only** laptop.

  2. My backpack of code, which I can access and edit almost anywhere and share with friends so they can improve it too. After all, this is the purpose of creating a repo, right?

  ### So, what next?

 - Feel free to explore, clone, or improve this repo yourself by making a pull request.
