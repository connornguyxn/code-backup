# 1. What is this?

This repository is for storing and sharing my written code from competitive programming websites. Most of the code here is pretty quick and dirty, some are even unfinished, so I would only advise checking them out if you want to have a good laugh.

## 2.1. File prefixes

The file prefixes used in this project represent the website the problem is on for easier access.

## 2.2. Interesting things to know

- Why faster input/output code works and cout.tie(NULL) does literally nothing:

- What is the differences between array-like types and when to use them:

- Why hash maps are OP:
> "What they can provide is at worst O(1) look up, which is something not provided anywhere else. It takes away the work of finding where a complement element would be in a list. So in problems like TwoSum, you can solve it O(N) rather than use a binary search to solve it in O(Nlogn)."
